# About this Repository

This repo hosts generic scripts that make DevOps easier. Whether it is cloud, github or any other touch point, this should be the first place I look to get things done.

## About Igor Loza

Igor has been working in Infrastructure Automation and DevOps since January 2010. His experience is primarily enterprise based, so GitHub repositories are going to be a little light due to ownership of IP. The items hosted here are generic in nature and have been retrospectively created outside of business hours.
